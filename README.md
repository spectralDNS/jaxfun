## Features

- Orthogonal polynomial and Fourier bases (Chebyshev, Legendre, Jacobi, etc.)
- Tensor product and direct sum spaces with boundary conditions
- Assembly of bilinear / linear forms with symbolic (SymPy) coefficients
- JAX-backed forward/backward transforms and differentiation
- Utilities for sparse conversion, preconditioning, and projection
- A friendly interface for experimenting with PINNs

## Installation

Using uv (recommended):

```bash
pip install uv  # if not already installed
uv add jaxfun   # when published
```

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spectralDNS/jaxfun.git
cd jaxfun
uv sync
```

## Quickstart

```python
from jaxfun.galerkin import Chebyshev, TensorProduct, TestFunction, TrialFunction
from jaxfun.galerkin.inner import inner

C = Chebyshev.Chebyshev(16)
T = TensorProduct((C, C))
v = TestFunction(T)
u = TrialFunction(T)
A = inner(u * v)
```

See the [`examples`](examples/) for more patterns.

## Development

Run tests (excluding slow):

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Run full (including slow demos):

```bash
uv run pytest -m "slow or not slow"
```

Lint & format:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```
